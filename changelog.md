# Change log

## 0.9.0

First beta release!

* Reorganize cpmpy/ modules (not backward-compatible)
* Rework variables/constraint constructors (deprecation warnings for old constructors, will be removed with stable release)
* Updated all examples to follow new style
* Add PySAT backend, with incrementality/core extraction (only accepts CNF input for now)
* Add minimize()/maximize() to Model() and solver objects
* simpler `from cpmpy.solvers import CPM_ortools` for solver-specific use
* Add keyword arguments to solve() that configure solver-specific options
* Add example of hyperparameter gridsearch
* Updated API and user docs considerably


## 0.7.2

* get_core() work around bug in upstream ortools

## 0.7.1

* still learning the right release flow, this is a stable release

## 0.7.0b

* still learning the right release flow

## 0.7.0

### Major
* Reworked solver interface so that it is near-identical to model interface
* Or-tools interface allows unsat core extraction!
* Add MARCO MUS enumerate as example of unsat core extraction usage
* variables now take a name= argument for variable name (easier debugging)

### Enhancements
* Added more examples: bibd, npuzzle
* Added 'table' global constraint
* Added support for time\_limit when calling solve()
* Added more tests on the flattening
* Add solution hints to ortools interface
* Improved documentation

### Bugfixes
* multiple fixes and improvements in ortools interface
* fix module (thanks HakanK)
* various bugfixes

## 0.6.0

### Major

* Or-tools is now the default backend

### Enhancements
* A new `flat normal form` with `flatten_model` transformation 
* Generic global constraint decompositions
* Adding more examples
* Documentation improvements.
* Multiple bug fixes related to the integration of OR-Tools
