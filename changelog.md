# Change log

## 0.9.17
Some new solvers supported at tier 3, update to our transformations and bugfixes.

### Solver tier updates:
* Choco and SCIP our now available as tier 3 solvers in separate pull requests.

### New transformations:
* Canonical comparison, puts comparisons in a canonical normal form.
* only_bv_reifies: the bool var is sent to the left part and the boolexpr to the right part in reifications. (split out of only_bv_implies)
* Only_implies: renamed what's left from only_bv_implies, that being removing all '==' double reifications.

### What else is new?
* Allow description for a constraint
* Updated linearize transformation
* small improvements to our docs
* solution hints in Exact
* New, more efficient Xor decomposition
* added QuickXplain to our tools.
* Did some performance tests and optimized our flatten_constraint transformation by not applying distributivity of disjunctions over conjunctions.

### Bugfixes:
* mark Inverse as supported in OR-tools
* removed unnecessary use of simplify bool in minizinc and z3
* fix possible overflow in bound computations
* Solution hinting fix, when giving N-D variables and values
* Solution hinting remove python 3.9 exclusive code
* Bugfixes in MUS-tool
* 
## 0.9.16
One of our most substantial releases so far, with special focus on extending and improving the
transformations for all allowed input and all solvers.

### Solver tier updates:
* MiniZinc and Z3 are now Tier1 solvers (passes all internal tests, passes our bigtest suit, will be fuzztested in the near future)
* new solver: Exact in Tier2 (passes all internal tests, might fail on edge cases in bigtest)
  Currently Exact is not supported on Windows

### Revamped documentation
* simpler readme on github, with badges
* simpler index file on readthedocs
* consolidated scattered documentation into one prominent 'modeling.html' file on readthedocs

### Global constraints
* Global functions (Minimum, Maximum, Element, Count, Abs) now separated from Global constraints in the class diagram
* New global constraint: InDomain, to specify non-interval domains.
* Abs is now a global
* Multi-dimensional element constraint supported

### New transformations:
* decompose_in_tree. Unsupported globals now get decomposed at tree-level.
* simplify_boolean, that simplifies boolean (and equivalent-to-Boolean) expressions.
* push_down_negation. Pushes down the not-operator so that it only occurs at the leaves of the expression tree

### What else is new?
* Warning messages for common beginner mistakes.
* type-checks in operator constructor and in global constraints/functions.
* our NDVarArray now support NumPy-like method 'prod', and supports the axis argument for min, max, sum, prod, any and all
* Updated tuner tool: added a (random) grid search tuner
* pysat: accept reified cardinality constraints
* z3: handle mixed integer/boolean expressions
* Add explicit requirements for jupyter notebooks examples
* Add n-queens 1000 example.
* solver interfaces: make `__add__()` directly call transform, simpler and more explicit (#312)

### Bugfixes:
* Allow numpy booleans in boolvals
* negating boolval fix
* check for bv == iv in normalized boolexpr and only_bv_implies
* Inverse decomposition with non vararrays
* Minizinc integer bounds fix
* Minizinc False literal now gets correctly translated.


## 0.9.15
Re-release of 0.9.14 due to github action pip-release screw-up

## 0.9.14
Hotfix release

Our builtin-overwrites 'any' and 'all' returned BoolVal's, and they did not yet have a `__bool__()` property so they would be correctly evaluated when used in 'if' functions and other standard python contexts. This can easily break user code that uses `any` or `all` when doing 'from cpmpy import \*'.

Unfortunately we merged the BoolVal branch with the above behaviour, even though we had a version that fixed it, but this was not yet pushed to the branch.

* This hotfix release fixes it so that `any` and `all` return standard Booleans again (and BoolVal has a `__bool__()` also).

* We also include a small fix to make the Inverse global constraint decomposition work for non-variable arrays too.


## 0.9.13
Solid progress release.

To make more clear how well-supported each of the solvers are, we introduced a tiered classification:

* Tier 1 solvers: passes all internal tests, passes our bigtest suit, will be fuzztested in the near future
    - "ortools" the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver
    - "pysat" the PySAT library and its many SAT solvers ("pysat:glucose4", "pysat:lingeling", etc)

* Tier 2 solvers: passes all internal tests, might fail on edge cases in bigtest
    - "minizinc" the MiniZinc modeling system and its many solvers ("minizinc:gecode", "minizinc:chuffed", etc)
    - "z3" the SMT solver and theorem prover
    - "gurobi" the MIP solver
    - "PySDD" a Boolean knowledge compiler

* Tier 3 solvers: they are work in progress and live in a pull request
    - "gcs" the Glasgow Constraint Solver
    - "exact" the Exact pseudo-boolean solver

We hope to upgrade many of these solvers to higher tiers, as well as adding new ones. Reach out on github if you want to help out.

New above the hood:
* added 'DirectConstraint', a generic way to post solver-specific constraints which CPMpy does not implement, with multiple examples such as ortools' automaton, circuit, multicircuit
* added 'Count' global constraint with decomposition
* added 'GlobalCardinalityCount' (GCC) global constraint with decomposition
* added 'Inverse' global constraint with with decomposition
* a Boolean 'IfThenElse' global constraint with decomposition c->if_true & (~c)->if_false

New under the hood:
* a BoolVal() expression object for constants True/False, better handling/cleaning of Bool constants as a result
* added a highly efficient 'toplevel_list' transformation that all solvers call to get a list of CPMpy expressions, simplifies what to expect as input for transformations
* 'decompose_globals' is now a transformation that decomposes the unsupported globals, it also does it best to properly handle 'numeric' globals, reified globals and negated globals

Changed:
* added missing decomposition for 'Table' global constraint
* highly optimized the 'get_variables' transformation
* pushed bounds computation into the expressions, more robust and extensible
* removed custom deepcopy() for Python's better built-in one
* slightly better handling of incomplete (partial) functions, e.g. in bounds computation (ongoing work)
* fixed bugs in MiniZinc and Z3's rewriting, related to int vs bool

* solveAll() return warning if an objective function is present
