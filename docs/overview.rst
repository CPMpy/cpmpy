Constraint Programming
----------------------

.. Basic concepts on Constraint programming
Many real-life decisions involve a large number of options. To decide if a problem is feasible or finding the best one amongst all the options is hard task to do by hand. In other words, to enumerate all the possible combinations of single decisions and evaluate them is infeasible in practice. To avoid this "*brute force*" approach, the paradigm of **constraint programming (CP)** allow us: 1. to model relationships between single decisions smartly; and 2. give an answer efficiently.

A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) consists of a set of variables and constraints stablishing relationships amongst them. Each variable has a finite of possible values (its domain).
