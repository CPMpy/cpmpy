CPMpy: Constraint Programming and Modeling in Python
====================================================

Constraint Programming is a methodology for solving combinatorial optimisation problems like assignment problems or covering, packing and scheduling problems. Problems that require searching over discrete decision variables.

CPMpy is a Constraint Programming and Modeling library in Python, based on numpy, with direct solver access. Key features are:

* Easy to integrate with machine learning and visualisation libraries, because decision variables are numpy arrays.
* Solver-independent: transparently translating to CP, MIP, SMT and SAT solvers
* Incremental solving and direct access to the underlying solvers
* and much more...

Supported solvers
-----------------

CPMpy can translate to many different solvers, and even provides direct access to them.

Different solvers excell at different problems. Try multiple!

* Our rule-of-thumb ordering when *solving* a problem: OrTools > Gurobi > Exact > Others
* Our rule-of-thumb ordering when *explaining* a problem: Exact > Z3 > OrTools > Others


To make clear how well supported and tested these solvers are, we work with a tiered classification:

* Tier 1 solvers: passes all internal tests, passes our bigtest suit, will be fuzztested in the near future
    - "ortools" the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver
    - "pysat" the PySAT library and its many SAT solvers ("pysat:glucose4", "pysat:lingeling", etc)

* Tier 2 solvers: passes all internal tests, might fail on edge cases in bigtest
    - "minizinc" the MiniZinc modeling system and its many solvers ("minizinc:gecode", "minizinc:chuffed", etc)
    - "z3" the SMT solver and theorem prover
    - "gurobi" the MIP solver
    - "PySDD" a Boolean knowledge compiler
    - "exact" the Exact integer linear programming solver
    - "choco" the Choco constraint solver
    - "gcs" the Glasgow Constraint Solver

* Tier 3 solvers: they are work in progress and live in a pull request
    - "scip" the SCIP Optimisation Suite (open source MIP solver)

We hope to upgrade many of these solvers to higher tiers, as well as adding new ones. Reach out on github if you want to help out.

Source code and bug reports at https://github.com/CPMpy/cpmpy

CPMpy has the open-source `Apache 2.0 license <https://github.com/cpmpy/cpmpy/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ and is run as an open-source project. All discussions happen on Github, even between direct colleagues, and all changes are reviewed through pull requests.

**Join us!** We welcome any feedback and contributions. You are also free to reuse any parts in your own project. A good starting point to contribute is to add your models to the examples folder.


Are you a solver developer? We are keen to integrate solvers that have a python API on pip. If this is the case for you, or if you want to discuss what it best looks like, do contact us!
