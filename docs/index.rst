CPMpy: Constraint Programming and Modeling in Python
====================================================

Source code and issue tracker: https://github.com/CPMpy/cpmpy

CPMpy is ideal for solving combinatorial problems like assignment problems or covering, packing and scheduling problems. Problems that require searching over discrete decision variables.

Different solvers excel at different problems. `Try multiple! <modeling.html#selecting-a-solver>`_

**CPMpyâ€™s transformations** selectively rewrite only those constraint expressions that a solver does not support. While solvers can use any transformation they need, lower-level solvers largely reuse those of higher-level ones, creating a waterfall pattern:

Open Source
-----------

CPMpy is open source (`Apache 2.0 license <https://github.com/cpmpy/cpmpy/blob/master/LICENSE>`_) and the development process is open too: all discussions happen on GitHub, even between direct colleagues, and all changes are reviewed through pull requests.

**Join us!** We welcome any feedback and contributions. You are also free to reuse any parts in your own project. A good starting point to contribute is to add your models to the `examples folder <https://github.com/CPMpy/cpmpy/tree/master/examples>`_.


Are you a solver developer? We are keen to `integrate solvers <adding_solver.html>`_ that have a python API on pip. If this is the case for you, or if you want to discuss what it best looks like, do contact us!
