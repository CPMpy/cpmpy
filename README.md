    <b>CPMpy</b>: a <b>C</b>onstraint <b>P</b>rogramming and <b>M</b>odeling library in <b>Py</b>thon, based on numpy, with direct solver access.
</p>


**Documentation: [https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/)**

---

### Constraint solving at your finger tips

For combinatorial problems with Boolean and integer variables. With many high-level constraints that are automatically decomposed when not natively supported by the solver.

Lightweight, [well-documented](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/), used in research and industry. 

### üîë Key Features

* **Solver-agnostic**: use and compare CP, ILP, SMT, PB and SAT solvers
* **ML-friendly**: decision variables are numpy arrays, with vectorized operations and constraints
* **Incremental solving**: assumption variables, adding constraints and updating objectives
* **Extensively tested**: large test-suite and [actively fuzz-tested](https://github.com/CPMpy/fuzz-test)
* **Tools**: for parameter-tuning, debugging and explanation generation
* **Flexible**: easy to add constraints or solvers, also direct solver access

### üî© Solvers

CPMpy can translate to a wide variety of constraint solving paradigms, including both commercial and open-source solvers.

* **CP Solvers**: OR-Tools (default), IBM CP Optimizer (license required), Choco, Glasgow GCS, MiniZinc+solvers
* **ILP Solvers**: Gurobi (license required)
* **SMT Solvers**: Z3
* **PB Solvers**: Exact
* **SAT Solvers**: PySAT+solvers, PySDD

### <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.2em;">&lt;/&gt;</span> Example: flexible jobshop scheduling

An example that also demonstrates CPMpy's seamless integration into the scientific Python ecosystem:

```python
# Flexible job-shop: a set of jobs must be run, each can be run on any of the machines,
# with different duration and energy consumption. Minimize makespan and total energy consumption
import cpmpy as cp
import pandas as pd
import random; random.seed(1)

# --- Data definition ---
num_jobs = 15
num_machines = 3
# Generate some data: [job_id, machine_id, duration, energy]
data = [[jobid, machid, random.randint(2, 8), random.randint(5, 15)]
        for jobid in range(num_jobs) for machid in range(num_machines)]
df_data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['job_id', 'machine_id', 'duration', 'energy'])

# Compute maximal horizon (crude upper bound) and number of alternatives
horizon = df_data.groupby('job_id')['duration'].max().sum()
num_alternatives = len(df_data.index)
assert list(df_data.index) == list(range(num_alternatives)), "Index must be default integer (0,1,..)"


# --- Decision variables ---
start = cp.intvar(0, horizon, name="start", shape=num_alternatives)
end   = cp.intvar(0, horizon, name="end", shape=num_alternatives)
active = cp.boolvar(name="active", shape=num_alternatives)

# --- Constraints ---
model = cp.Model()

# Each job must have one active alternative
for job_id, group in df_data.groupby('job_id'):
    model += (cp.sum(active[group.index]) == 1)

# For all jobs ensure start + dur = end (also for inactives, thats OK)
model += (start + df_data['duration'] == end)

# No two active alternatives on the same machine may overlap; (ab)use cumulative with 'active' as demand.
for mach_id, group in df_data.groupby('machine_id'):
    sel = group.index
    model += cp.Cumulative(start[sel], group['duration'].values, end[sel], active[sel], capacity=1)

# --- Objectives ---
# Makespan: max over all active alternatives
makespan = cp.intvar(0, horizon, name="makespan")
for i in range(num_alternatives):
    model += active[i].implies(makespan >= end[i])  # end times of actives determines makespan

# Total energy consumption
total_energy = cp.sum(df_data['energy'] * active)

# Minimize makespan first, then total energy
model.minimize(100 * makespan + total_energy)


# --- solving and graphical visualisation ---
if model.solve():
    print(model.status())
    print("Total makespan:", makespan.value(), "energy:", total_energy.value())

    # Visualize with Plotly's excellent Gantt chart support
    import plotly.express as px
    df_solution = df_data[active.value() == True].copy()  # Select rows where active is True
    df_solution["start"] = pd.to_datetime(start[df_solution.index].value(), unit="m")
    df_solution["end"] = pd.to_datetime(end[df_solution.index].value(), unit="m")
    px.timeline(df_solution, x_start="start", x_end="end", y="machine_id", color="job_id", text="energy").show()
else:
    print("No solution found.")
```

You can then compare the runtime of all installed solvers, or [much more](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/)...
```python
for solvername in cp.SolverLookup.solvernames():
    try:
        model.solve(solver=solvername, time_limit=10)  # max 10 seconds
        print(f"{solvername}: {model.status()}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{solvername}: Not run -- {str(e)}")
```

### üå≥ Ecosystem

CPMpy is part of the scientific Python ecosystem, making it easy to use in Jupyter notebooks, to add visualisations, or to use it in machine learning pipelines.

Other projects that build on CPMpy:
* [XCP-explain](https://github.com/CPMpy/XCP-explain): a library for explainable constraint programming
* [PyConA](https://github.com/CPMpy/pyconA): a library for constraint acquisition
* [Fuzz-Test](https://github.com/CPMpy/fuzz-test): fuzz testing of constraint solvers
* [Sudoku Assistant](https://sudoku-assistant.cs.kuleuven.be): an Android app for sudoku scanning, solving and intelligent hints
* [CHAT-Opt demonstrator](https://chatopt.cs.kuleuven.be): translates natural language problem descriptions into CPMpy models

Also, CPMpy participated in the [2024 XCSP3 competition](https://www.xcsp.org/competitions/), making its solvers win 3 gold and 1 silver medal.


## üîß Library development

CPMpy has the open-source [Apache 2.0 license]( https://github.com/cpmpy/cpmpy/blob/master/LICENSE) and is run as an open-source project. All discussions happen on Github, even between direct colleagues, and all changes are reviewed through pull requests. 

Join us! We welcome any feedback and contributions. You are also free to reuse any parts in your own project. A good starting point to contribute is to add your models to the `examples/` folder.

Are you a **solver developer**? We are keen to integrate solvers that have a Python API and are on pip. Check out our [adding solvers](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adding_solver.html) documentation and contact us!
