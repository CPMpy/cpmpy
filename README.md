CPMpy is a Constraint Programming and Modeling library in Python, based on numpy, with direct solver access.

* Easy to integrate with machine learning and visualisation libraries, because decision variables are numpy arrays.
* Solver-independent: transparently translating to CP, MIP, SMT, SAT
* Incremental solving and direct access to the underlying solvers
* and much more...

**Documentation: [https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/)**

CPMpy is still in Beta stage, and bugs can still occur. If so, please report the issue on Github!

### Open Source

CPMpy is run as an open-source project. All discussions happen on Github, even between direct colleagues, and all changes are reviewed through pull requests. 

Join us! We welcome any feedback and contributions. You are also free to reuse any parts in your own project. A good starting point to contribute is to add your models to the examples folder.


Are you a solver developer? We are keen to integrate solvers that have a python API on pip. If this is the case for you, or if you want to discuss what it best looks like, do contact us!

### Acknowledgments
Part of the development received funding through Prof. Tias Guns his European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator grant, under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 101002802, [CHAT-Opt](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~tias.guns/chat-opt.html)).
