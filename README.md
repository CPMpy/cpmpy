### Constraint solving at your finger tips

For combinatorial optimisation problems with Boolean and integer variables. With many high-level constraints that are automatically decomposed as needed for the solver.

Lightweight, [well-documented](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/), used in research and industry. 

### üîë Key Features

* **Solver-agnostic**: use and compare CP, MIP, SMT, PB and SAT solvers
* **ML-friendly**: decision variables are numpy arrays, vectorized operators and constraints
* **Incremental solving**: assumption variables, adding constraints and updating objectives
* **Extensively tested**: large test-suite and [actively fuzz-tested](https://github.com/CPMpy/fuzz-test)
* **Tools**: for parameter-tuning, debugging and explanation generation
* **Flexible**: easy to add constraints or solvers, also direct solver access
* **Open Source**: [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/cpmpy/cpmpy/blob/master/LICENSE)

### üî© Solvers

CPMpy can translate to a wide variaty of constraint solving paradigms, including both commercial and open-source solvers.

* **CP Solvers**: OR-Tools (default), IBM CP Optimizer (license required), Choco, Glasgow GCS, MiniZinc+solvers
* **MIP Solvers**: Gurobi (license required), IBM CPLEX (license required)
* **SMT Solvers**: Z3
* **PB Solvers**: Exact
* **SAT Solvers**: PySAT+solvers, PySDD

### üå≥ Ecosystem

CPMpy is part of the scientific Python ecosystem, making it easy to use it in Jupyter notebooks, to add visualisations with matplotlib, or to use it in a machine learning pipeline.

Other projects that build on CPMpy:
* [PyConA](https://github.com/CPMpy/pyconA): a cpmpy-based library for constraint acquisition
* [XCP-explain](https://github.com/CPMpy/XCP-explain): a library for explainable constraint programming
* [Fuzz-Test](https://github.com/CPMpy/fuzz-test): fuzz testing of constraint solvers
* [Sudoku Assistant](https://sudoku-assistant.cs.kuleuven.be): an Android app for sudoku scanning, solving and intelligent hints
* [CHAT-Opt demonstrator](https://chatopt.cs.kuleuven.be): translates natural language problem descriptions into CPMpy models

Also, CPMpy participated in the [2024 XCSP3 competition](https://www.xcsp.org/competitions/), making its solvers win 3 gold and 1 silver medal.

## üîß Library development

CPMpy has the open-source [Apache 2.0 license]( https://github.com/cpmpy/cpmpy/blob/master/LICENSE) and is run as an open-source project. All discussions happen on Github, even between direct colleagues, and all changes are reviewed through pull requests. 

Join us! We welcome any feedback and contributions. You are also free to reuse any parts in your own project. A good starting point to contribute is to add your models to the `examples/` folder.

Are you a **solver developer**? We are keen to integrate solvers that have a Python API on pip. Check out our [adding solvers](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adding_solver.html) documentation and contact us!
