"""
    Solver interfaces have the same API as :class:`Model <cpmpy.model.Model>`.
    However some solvers are **incremental**, meaning that after solving a problem, you can add constraints or change
    the objective, and the next solve will reuse as much information from the previous solve as possible.
    Some clause learning solvers also support solving with **assumptions**, meaning you can solve the same problem with
    different assumption variables toggled on/off, and the solver will reuse information from the previous solves.

    See :ref:`supported-solvers` for the list of solvers and their capabilities.

    To benefit from incrementality, you have to instantiate the solver object and reuse it, rather than working on a Model object.
    Solvers must be instantiated throught the static :class:`cp.SolverLookup <cpmpy.solvers.utils.SolverLookup>` class:

    - :meth:`cp.SolverLookup.solvernames() <cpmpy.solvers.utils.SolverLookup.solvernames>` -- List all installed solvers (including subsolvers).
    - :meth:`cp.SolverLookup.get(solvername, model=None) <cpmpy.solvers.utils.SolverLookup.get>` -- Initialize a specific solver.

    For example creating a CPMpy solver object for OR-Tools:

    .. code-block:: python

        import cpmpy as cp
        s = cp.SolverLookup.get("ortools")
        # can now use solver object 's' over and over again
