"""
  Converts the logical constraints into disjuctions using the tseitin transform,
        including flattening global constraints that are is_bool() and not in `supported`.
  
  Other constraints are copied verbatim so this transformation
  can also be used in non-pure CNF settings

  The implementation first converts the list of constraints
  to 'flat normal form', this already flattens subexpressions using
  auxiliary variables.

  What is then left to do is to tseitin encode the following into CNF:
  - BV with BV a BoolVar (or NegBoolView)
  - or([BV]) constraint
  - and([BV]) constraint
  - BE != BV  with BE :: BV|or()|and()|BV!=BV|BV==BV|BV->BV
  - BE == BV
  - BE -> BV
  - BV -> BE
