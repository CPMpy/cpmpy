        - supported_reified: a set of supported reified global constraints (globals with Boolean return type only)
        - toplevel: a list of constraints that should be added toplevel, carried as pass by reference to recursive calls

        Special care taken for unsupported global constraints in reified contexts and for numeric global constraints
            in a comparison.

        Supported numerical global functions remain in the expression tree as is. They can be rewritten using
            `cpmpy.transformations.reification.reify_rewrite`
            The following `bv -> NumExpr <comp> Var/Const` can be rewritten as  [bv -> IV0 <comp> Var/Const, NumExpr == IV0].
            So even if numerical constraints are not supported in reified context, we can rewrite them to non-reified versions.
