"""
    The :class:`Model <cpmpy.model.Model>` class is a lazy container for constraints and an objective function.
    Constraints and objectives are CPMpy :mod:`expressions <cpmpy.expressions>`.

    It is lazy in that it only stores the constraints and objective that are added
    to it. Processing only starts when :meth:`solve() <cpmpy.model.Model.solve>` is called, and this does not modify
    the constraints or objective stored in the model.

    A model can be solved multiple times, and constraints can be added inbetween solve calls.
    Note that constraints are added using the ``+=`` operator (implemented by :meth:`__add__() <cpmpy.model.Model.__add__>`).

    See the full list of functions below.
