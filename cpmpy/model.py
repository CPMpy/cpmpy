"""
    The `Model` class is a lazy container for constraints and an objective function.

    It is lazy in that it only stores the constraints and objective that are added
    to it. Processing only starts when solve() is called, and this does not modify
    the constraints or objective stored in the model.

    A model can be solved multiple times, and constraints can be added to it inbetween
    solve calls.

    See the examples for basic usage, which involves:

    - creation, e.g. m = Model(cons, minimize=obj)
    - solving, e.g. m.solve()
    - optionally, checking status/runtime, e.g. m.status()
