    ==================
    Contains the abstract class `SolverInterface` for defining solver interfaces,
    as well as a class `SolverStatus` that collects solver statistics,
    and the `ExitStatus` class that represents possible exist statuses.

    Each solver has its own class that inherits from `SolverInterface`.
