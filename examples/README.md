CPMpy examples
==============

The examples in this folder show how to model and solve different constraint satisfaction and optimisation problems.

The `advanced` folder contains more advanced examples, often involving multiple calls to solvers such as when doing hyperparameter optimisation of solver parameters or when computing minimal unsatisfiable subsets.
