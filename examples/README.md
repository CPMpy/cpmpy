## Notebook examples:

You can run these in google colab, on binder or view them on github.

### `quickstart_sudoku.ipynb`
A quickstart guido to constraint solving, using the venerable sudoku problem.

### `nqueens_1000.ipynb`
Another classic constraint satisfaction problem, N-queens (with visualisation and parameter tuning for larger N).

### `vehicle_routing.ipynb`
Exact vehicle routing model, with nice visualisation on real world map.

### `scheduling.ipynb`
A makespan minimising jobshop problem, with nice Gantt visualisation.

### `room_assignment.ipynb`
A real-life room assignment problem, do the room requests fit in the hotel?

### `car_sequencing.ipynb`
CSPlib problem number 1, nicely demonstrates the complex expressions CP can handle.

### `packing_rectangles.ipynb`
A 2D rectangular packing problem, with visualisation.

### `tsp.ipynb`
The Traveling Salesman Problem, just a simple `circuit` global constraint for CP.

### `graph_coloring.ipynb`
The graph coloring problem, while actually coloring a graph.

`map_coloring_oz.ipynb` is also a graph coloring problem, while actually coloring the map of australia.
