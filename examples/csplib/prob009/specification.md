The perfect square placement problem (also called the squared square problem) is 
to pack a set of squares with given integer sizes into a bigger square in such 
a way that no squares overlap each other and all square borders are parallel to 
the border of the big square. For a perfect placement problem, all squares have 
different sizes. The sum of the square surfaces is equal to the surface of the 
packing square, so that there is no spare capacity. A simple perfect square 
placement problem is a perfect square placement problem in which no subset of 
the squares (greater than one) are placed in a rectangle.
