Title:    Magic Squares and Sequences

An order $n$ magic square is a $n$ by $n$ matrix containing the numbers $1$
to $n^2$, with each row, column and main diagonal equal the same
sum. As well as finding magic squares, we are interested in the number
of a given size that exist.  There are several interesting
variations. For example, we may insist on certain values in certain
squares (like in quasigroup completion) and ask if the magic square
can be completed. In a heterosquare, each row, column and diagonal
sums to a different value. In an anti-magic square, the row, column
and diagonal sums form a sequence of consecutive integers.

A magic sequence of length $n$ is a sequence of integers $x_0 \ldots
x_{n-1}$ between $0$ and $n-1$, such that for all $i$ in $0$ to $n-1$,
the number $i$ occurs exactly $x_i$ times in the sequence. For instance,
$6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0$ is a magic sequence since $0$ occurs $6$ times
in it, $1$ occurs twice, etc.
