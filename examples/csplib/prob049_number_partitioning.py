Problem 049 on CSPLib
https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob049/

This problem consists in finding a partition of numbers 1..N into two sets A and B such that:

A and B have the same cardinality
sum of numbers in A = sum of numbers in B
sum of squares of numbers in A = sum of squares of numbers in B
There is no solution for N<8.
