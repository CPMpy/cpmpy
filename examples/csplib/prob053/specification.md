Title:    Graceful Graphs

A labelling $f$ of the nodes of a graph with $q$ edges is graceful if $f$ assigns each
node a unique label from $\{0, 1, \ldots , q\}$ and when each edge $xy$ is labelled with
$|f(x)-f(y)|$, the edge labels are all different. Gallian surveys graceful graphs, i.e. graphs with a graceful labelling, and lists the
graphs whose status is known.

{prob007} is a special case of a graceful graph where the graph is a line.
