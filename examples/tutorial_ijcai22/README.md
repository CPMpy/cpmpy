# Using constraint solvers as an oracle, with CPMpy

## A tutorial at IJCAI-ECAI 2022

## Sat, July 23 2022, room Stolz1, A2: afternoon block 2

Constraint solving (including SAT, CP, MIP) is a central paradigm for reasoning in AI, and CPMpy is a modern python-based constraint library that is solver-independent.

This tutorial shows how it can be used to efficiently _integrate constraint solvers_ as oracles in other algorithms, while making use of efficient low-level solvers and their incremental properties.

**Slide material and runnable notebooks will be posted in this folder, at least a day before the tutorial**

## Content

The tutorial will consist of 6 parts:

* Quick introduction to constraint solving with CPMpy
* Repeated and incremental solving
* Introduction to master/sub-problem solving
* Explaining unsatisfiabilty: examples of master/sub-problem solving
* Advanced examples: implicit hitting set and cutting plane algorithms
* Conclusion, outlook and questions
