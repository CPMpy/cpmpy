"""
    Blocks world

    Given a k piles of blocks in a starting configuration, find the shortest sequence of block moves
        to arrive at at a given goal configuration.
    A block can only move to another block if it is on top of the pile.
    At most k piles can be used (some piles may be empty)

    This file showcases two ways of solving the problem.
    The first model is an optimization model with a heuristic upper bound on the number of moves as initial bound.
    The second appraoch is a "planning as SAT" approach where the model is solved iteratively with an increasing horizon

    Both models are inspired by the MiniZinc model:
