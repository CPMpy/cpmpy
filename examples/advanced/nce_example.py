Counterfactual explanation of a user query.

Based on application on the knapsack problem of Korikov, A., & Beck, J. C. Counterfactual Explanations via Inverse Constraint Programming.

Usecase:
 1) Some optimal solution x* is provided to the user by a constraint optimization solver.
 2) User enters a query to change solution variables x_i to a new value.
    This extra set of constraints is used to generate a new optimal solution x_d
 3) Using inverse optimization, we calculate the values of constraints the objective function which result in x_d being the optimal solution.
    Extra constraint: only values corresponding to foil items are allowed to change.
 4) The user is presented with the result.


Given:
    A constraint optimization problem (c, f, X) with an optimal solution x*
    A set of foil constraints assigning a value to variables in x*, resulting in x_d
Find:
    d such that min(f(d,X)) == x_d and ||c - d|| is minimal


The algorithm consists of 2 alternating problems: the master problem (MP), and the sub problem (SP)

Algorithm:
    1 S = {}
    2 Solve MP to obtain optimal d*
    3 Solve SP with d* as c to obtain x_0
    4 if objective(x_d) > objective(x_0):
        add x_0 to S
        go to 2
      else:
          return d*


Master problem:
    Constraints:
        - constraints of original forward problem
        - objective(d*, x) >= objective(d*, x_0) forall x_0 in S
        - foil constraints assigning values to x_i
        - foil contraints restricting the altering of c to match the foil constraint indices
    Objective:
        - Minimize || c - d* ||_1

Sub problem:
    The original forward problem
