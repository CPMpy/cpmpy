        Optimal Constrained Unsatisfiable Subsets (OCUS) for CSP explanations [1]

        explain_one_step_ocus relies on the implicit hitting set duality between
        MUSes and MCSes for a given formula F [2, 3]:

            - A set S \subseteq of F is an MCS of F iff it is a minimal hitting set
             of MUSs(F).
            - A set S \subseteq F is a MUS of F iff it is a minimal hitting set
             of MCSs(F).

        Builds a MIP model for computing minimal (optimal) hitting sets. Repeatedly
        checks for satisfiability until UNSAT, which means an OCUS is found.
        If SAT, and sat solver computes a model. The complement w.r.t F is
        computed and added as a new set-to-hit.

        MIP MODEL
        ---------

        The constrained optimal hitting set is described by:

            - x_l={0,1} is a boolean decision variable if the literal is inside the
                        hitting set or not.
            - w_l=f(l) is the cost assigned to having the literal in the hitting
                        set.
            - c_lj={0,1} is 1 (0) if the literal l is (not) present in the set-to-hit j.

        Objective:
                min sum(x_l * w_l) over all l in I + (-Iend \ -I)

        Subject to:
            (1) sum x_l * c_lj >= 1 for all hitting sets j.
                = The hitting set must hit all sets-to-hit.

            (2) sum x_l == 1 for l in (-Iend \ -I)
                = exactly 1 literal explained at a time
