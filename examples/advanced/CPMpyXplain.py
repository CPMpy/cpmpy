"""
Finding counterfactual explanation through constraint relaxation.

Based on the "CounterFactualXplain"-algorithm of Dev Gupta, S., GenÃ§, B., O'Sullivan, B. (2022, 7 april). Finding Counterfactual
 Explanations Through Constraint Relaxation. arXiv:2204.03429v1.

An adapted algorithm which finds counterfactual explanations of the laptop problem presented in the paper.

Use cases (changes possible with enable_iteration variable):
- Default: One explanation, the order in which the constraints are considered is the same order as in which the user_constraints are mentioned in the 'user_constraints'-variable
- An explanation for every possible order in which the constraints can be considered
